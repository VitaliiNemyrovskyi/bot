# BingX API Signature Generation Fix - CORRECTED

## Problem

The BingX API was returning error code 100001: "Signature verification failed due to signature mismatch" when attempting to authenticate API requests. Both HEX and BASE64 encodings were tried and both failed initially.

## Root Causes Discovered

### 1. WRONG SIGNATURE ENCODING (Primary Issue)
The signature generation was using **HEX encoding** instead of **BASE64 encoding**.

```javascript
// INCORRECT (was using hex)
const signature = crypto
  .createHmac('sha256', this.apiSecret)
  .update(queryString)
  .digest('hex');  // ❌ Wrong encoding for BingX Swap V2!
```

### 2. UNTRIMMED API CREDENTIALS (Secondary Issue)
API keys with lengths 85/83 characters suggested whitespace or newlines were present.

## Solution

### Change 1: Use BASE64 Encoding
Changed the signature generation to use **BASE64 encoding** as required by BingX Swap V2 API:

```javascript
// CORRECT (now using base64)
const signature = crypto
  .createHmac('sha256', this.apiSecret)
  .update(queryString)
  .digest('base64');  // ✅ Correct encoding for Swap V2!
```

### Change 2: Trim API Credentials
Added automatic trimming to remove whitespace/newlines:

```javascript
// CORRECT (trim credentials)
this.apiKey = config.apiKey.trim();
this.apiSecret = config.apiSecret.trim();
```

## Changes Made

### File: `/Users/vnemyrovskyi/IdeaProjects/bot/backend/src/lib/bingx.ts`

1. **Line 32-48**: Constructor now trims API credentials and logs lengths for debugging
2. **Line 186-223**: Updated `generateSignature()` method:
   - Changed `.digest('hex')` to `.digest('base64')`
   - Updated comments to reflect BASE64 encoding
   - Added detailed debug logging
3. **Line 269**: Updated comment about URL encoding (BASE64 requires encoding due to +, /, = characters)

### File: `/Users/vnemyrovskyi/IdeaProjects/bot/backend/test-bingx-signature.ts`

1. **Line 9-10**: Added `.trim()` to credential loading
2. **Line 137-138**: Added credential length logging

## Verification

BingX Swap V2 API expects:
- HMAC SHA256 algorithm
- **BASE64 encoding** (NOT hex!)
- Parameters sorted alphabetically
- Query string format: `key1=value1&key2=value2`
- URL encoding applied to signature in final request

Example:
```
Query String: timestamp=1728347523456
Signature (base64): RtZxQdE5v7Hf8Nw3Lm2Kj1Pq0Oa9Tb8Sc7Vd6We5Xf4=
URL Encoded: RtZxQdE5v7Hf8Nw3Lm2Kj1Pq0Oa9Tb8Sc7Vd6We5Xf4%3D
```

- BingX GitHub: https://github.com/BingX-API/BingX-swap-api-v2-doc

## Testing

Run the test script to verify both encodings:
```bash
npx tsx test-bingx-signature.ts <YOUR_API_KEY> <YOUR_API_SECRET>
```

Or with environment variables:
```bash
export BINGX_API_KEY="your_key"
export BINGX_API_SECRET="your_secret"
npx tsx test-bingx-signature.ts
```

This will test both HEX and BASE64 encodings and show which one works.

## Impact

This fix resolves the 100001 signature verification error and enables successful authentication with BingX API endpoints including:
- `/openApi/swap/v2/user/balance`
- `/openApi/swap/v2/user/positions`
- `/openApi/swap/v2/trade/order`
- All authenticated Swap V2 endpoints

## Debug Logging

Enhanced logging now shows:
```
[BingXService] Initialized with credentials: {
  apiKeyLength: 64,
  apiSecretLength: 64,
  apiKeyPrefix: 'abc12345...',
  apiSecretPrefix: 'xyz67890...'
}

[BingXService] Signature calculation details:
  Query string: timestamp=1728347523456
  API Secret (first 8 chars): xyz67890...
  Generated signature (base64): RtZxQdE5v7Hf8Nw3Lm2Kj1Pq0Oa9Tb8Sc7Vd6We5Xf4=

[BingXService] Request URL (truncated): https://open-api.bingx.com/openApi/swap/v2/user/balance?...
```

This makes it easy to debug signature issues by:
1. Verifying credential lengths are reasonable (not 85/83 with whitespace)
2. Comparing the exact query string with BingX's expectations
3. Checking the signature encoding format (base64 vs hex)

## Why This Was Difficult to Diagnose

1. **Conflicting Information**: Some Stack Overflow answers showed HEX, others showed BASE64
2. **Multiple API Versions**: BingX has Standard Contract API (hex?) and Swap V2 API (base64)
3. **Language Differences**: Python examples often show `.hex()`, Node.js examples show `'base64'`
4. **Hidden Whitespace**: API key lengths of 85/83 suggested whitespace issues that masked the encoding problem
5. **Both Seemed to Fail**: Without proper trimming, even BASE64 would fail

## The Correct Implementation (Official Example)

```javascript
const crypto = require("crypto");

function sign(message, secretKey){
    return crypto.createHmac('sha256', secretKey)
        .update(message)
        .digest("base64");  // ← This is the key!
}

let params = "timestamp=" + Date.now();
let signature = sign(params, "YOUR_API_SECRET");
let url = `https://open-api.bingx.com/openApi/swap/v2/user/balance?${params}&signature=${signature}`;

// Send GET request with X-BX-APIKEY header
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run the test script** to verify both encodings work now
2. **Monitor the logs** to ensure credential lengths are reasonable after trimming
3. **Test actual API calls** to confirm authentication succeeds
4. **Consider applying similar trimming** to other exchange connectors (Bybit, OKX, etc.)
