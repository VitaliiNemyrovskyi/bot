# Exchange Credentials Backend Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a complete multi-exchange credentials management system with support for Bybit (fully validated), Binance, OKX, Kraken, and Coinbase. The system supports separate testnet and mainnet environments, automatic credential validation, encryption, and active credential management.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Database Schema
**File**: `/Users/vnemyrovskyi/IdeaProjects/bot/backend/prisma/schema.prisma`

**Changes**:
- Added `Exchange` enum (BYBIT, BINANCE, OKX, KRAKEN, COINBASE)
- Added `Environment` enum (TESTNET, MAINNET)
- Created `ExchangeCredentials` model with:
  - Multi-exchange support
  - Environment separation (testnet/mainnet)
  - Encrypted API keys and secrets
  - Active status management
  - User-friendly labels
  - Unique constraint on (userId, exchange, environment)
  - Optimized indexes for query performance
- Updated `User` model to include `exchangeCredentials` relation

**Database pushed**: Schema changes applied successfully with `prisma db push`

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Run migration script if you have existing Bybit credentials:
   ```bash
   npx ts-node src/lib/migrations/migrate-bybit-to-exchange-credentials.ts
   ```

2. Update existing services to use new API:
   ```typescript
   // Old way (deprecated)
   const keys = await BybitKeysService.getApiKeys(userId);

   // New way
   const credentials = await ExchangeCredentialsService.getActiveCredentials(
     userId,
     Exchange.BYBIT
   );
   ```

3. Test all endpoints with your frontend application

### Future Enhancements
1. Implement Binance validation
2. Implement OKX validation
3. Implement Kraken validation
4. Implement Coinbase validation
5. Add rate limiting per exchange
6. Add audit logging
7. Add 2FA for credential updates
8. Add IP whitelisting support
9. Add credential rotation reminders
10. Add webhook notifications

---

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these environment variables are set:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

# Encryption (must be at least 32 characters)
ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-secure-encryption-key-here"

# JWT Authentication
JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret"
```

## Dependencies Used

No new dependencies were added. The implementation uses:
- `@prisma/client` - Database ORM
- `zod` - Request validation (already installed)
- `crypto` (Node.js built-in) - Encryption
