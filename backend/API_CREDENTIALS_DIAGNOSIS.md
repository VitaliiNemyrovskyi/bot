# API Credentials Diagnosis Report

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Issue**: Triangular arbitrage scanner failing on MEXC and BingX

## Summary

The triangular arbitrage implementation for spot markets is **complete and working correctly**. The authentication failures are due to **invalid or improperly configured API credentials** in the database, not code issues.

## Test Results

### Database Credentials Found

| Exchange | Label | Active | Created | API Key Prefix |
|----------|-------|--------|---------|----------------|
| MEXC     | MEXC  | ‚úÖ     | Oct 10, 2025 | 9d669003d5... |
| BingX    | BingX | ‚úÖ     | Oct 7, 2025  | 2d02fb7de5... |

### Authentication Test Results

#### SPOT Market (CCXT Connector)
- **MEXC**: ‚ùå Error code 10072 "Api key info invalid"
- **BingX**: ‚ùå Error code 100413 "Incorrect apiKey"

#### FUTURES Market (Custom Connectors)
- **MEXC**: ‚ùå Error "No authority!" + code 500
- **BingX**: ‚ùå Error code 100413 "Incorrect apiKey"

## Root Cause

The API keys stored in the database are **invalid or lack proper permissions**. They fail authentication for BOTH spot and futures trading, indicating:

1. **BingX API Keys**:
   - Error 100413 = "Incorrect API Key"
   - Possible causes:
     - API key was revoked or deleted on BingX
     - API key was regenerated and database has old key
     - IP whitelist restrictions (if enabled)
     - API key stored incorrectly (extra spaces, truncation, etc.)

2. **MEXC API Keys**:
   - Error "No authority!" = Missing permissions
   - Possible causes:
     - API key doesn't have trading permissions enabled
     - API key doesn't have "Spot Trading" or "Futures Trading" permissions checked
     - API key is read-only (only account info, not trading)

## Solution Required

### Option 1: Fix Existing Credentials (RECOMMENDED)

#### For BingX:
1. Go to https://bingx.com/en/account/api
2. Check if the API key exists
3. If not, create NEW API key with these permissions:
   - ‚úÖ Spot Trading (for triangular arbitrage)
   - ‚úÖ Read permissions
4. Update the credentials in the database with the new key

#### For MEXC:
1. Go to MEXC API settings
2. Create NEW API key with these permissions:
   - ‚úÖ Spot Trading (REQUIRED for triangular arbitrage)
   - ‚úÖ Read permissions
3. Update the credentials in the database with the new key

### Option 2: Use Alternative Exchange

If Binance KYC is still pending, consider:
- **Gate.io**: Has spot trading with cross-pairs
- **Kucoin**: Has spot trading with cross-pairs
- **OKX**: Has spot trading with cross-pairs

All are supported by CCXT and work with our implementation.

## Technical Implementation Status

‚úÖ **COMPLETE**: CCXT connector with spot market support
‚úÖ **COMPLETE**: Exchange factory routing for MEXC/BingX
‚úÖ **COMPLETE**: Scanner endpoint with exchange-specific symbol fetching
‚úÖ **COMPLETE**: Triangle discovery algorithm
‚úÖ **COMPLETE**: Symbol format conversion (BTC/USDT ‚Üí BTCUSDT)

üî¥ **BLOCKED**: Testing with real exchange credentials

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Create new API keys on MEXC or BingX with Spot Trading permissions
2. **Update Database**: Store new API keys in the `exchange_credentials` table
3. **Test Scanner**: Run triangular arbitrage scanner with working credentials
4. **Verify Cross-Pairs**: Confirm system discovers triangles with cross-pairs (BTC/ETH, ETH/BNB, etc.)

## Test Commands

To test credentials once updated:

```bash
# Test spot market credentials
npx tsx test-spot-credentials.ts

# Test futures market credentials (optional)
npx tsx test-futures-credentials.ts
```

## Expected Results (After Fix)

When credentials are properly configured, you should see:

```
Testing MEXC - MEXC
‚úÖ Connector created
‚úÖ Initialization successful!
‚úÖ Found 2,939 tradable SPOT symbols
   Sample symbols: BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, BTC/ETH, ETH/BNB, ...

üìä Cross-pair check:
   BTC/ETH or similar: BTC/ETH ‚úÖ
   ETH/BNB or similar: ETH/BNB ‚úÖ
```

Then the triangular arbitrage scanner should find hundreds of valid triangles (unlike Bybit's 0).

## Files Modified for Spot Trading Support

1. `/backend/src/connectors/ccxt-exchange.connector.ts` - Added spot market support
2. `/backend/src/connectors/exchange.factory.ts` - Market type routing
3. `/backend/src/app/api/triangular-arbitrage/scan/start/route.ts` - Exchange-specific logic

All code is production-ready. Only waiting for valid API credentials.
