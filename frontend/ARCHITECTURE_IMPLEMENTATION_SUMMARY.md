## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (2-3 days)

**Priority: CRITICAL - Must be done first**

1. **Create Type Definitions**
   ```bash
   # Create models directory if it doesn't exist
   mkdir -p /Users/vnemyrovskyi/IdeaProjects/bot/frontend/src/app/models

   # Copy the models file
   cp /Users/vnemyrovskyi/IdeaProjects/bot/frontend/EXCHANGE_CREDENTIALS_MODELS.ts \
      /Users/vnemyrovskyi/IdeaProjects/bot/frontend/src/app/models/exchange-credentials.models.ts
   ```

2. **Update App Configuration**
   - Open `/Users/vnemyrovskyi/IdeaProjects/bot/frontend/src/app/config/app.config.ts`
   - Add the `exchangeCredentials` section from `UPDATED_APP_CONFIG.ts`
   - Add the new helper functions (`getParameterizedUrl`, `buildUrlWithQuery`)

3. **Create ExchangeEnvironmentService**
   ```bash
   # File: /Users/vnemyrovskyi/IdeaProjects/bot/frontend/src/app/services/exchange-environment.service.ts
   # Use implementation from SERVICE_INTERFACES.md section 1.1
   ```

4. **Create ExchangeCredentialsService**
   ```bash
   # File: /Users/vnemyrovskyi/IdeaProjects/bot/frontend/src/app/services/exchange-credentials.service.ts
   # Use implementation from SERVICE_INTERFACES.md section 2.1
   ```

5. **Update BybitUserService**
   - Inject `ExchangeEnvironmentService`
   - Add effect to react to environment changes
   - Update API calls to include environment parameter
   - See SERVICE_INTERFACES.md section 1.3 for details

6. **Update Routing**
   - Open `/Users/vnemyrovskyi/IdeaProjects/bot/frontend/src/app/app.routes.ts`
   - Add the new routes from `UPDATED_APP_ROUTES.ts`

**Verification:**
```typescript
// Test that services are created and injectable
import { ExchangeEnvironmentService } from './services/exchange-environment.service';
import { ExchangeCredentialsService } from './services/exchange-credentials.service';

// In a component:
constructor(
  private envService: ExchangeEnvironmentService,
  private credService: ExchangeCredentialsService
) {
  console.log('Environment:', this.envService.currentEnvironment());
  console.log('Credentials:', this.credService.credentials());
}
```

### Phase 2: Core Components (4-5 days)

4. **UI Polish**
   - Loading states and skeletons
   - Error messages and recovery
   - Success confirmations
   - Responsive design (mobile/tablet)
   - Accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Check bundle size
   - Optimize lazy loading
   - Test with large credential lists

## Quick Reference

### Key Services

```typescript
// ExchangeEnvironmentService - Global environment management
this.environmentService.currentEnvironment()  // Signal<EnvironmentType>
this.environmentService.setEnvironment(EnvironmentType.MAINNET)
this.environmentService.toggleEnvironment()
this.environmentService.isTestnet()  // Signal<boolean>

// ExchangeCredentialsService - Credential management
this.credentialsService.credentials()  // Signal<ExchangeCredential[]>
this.credentialsService.activeCredential()  // Signal<ExchangeCredential | null>
this.credentialsService.hasCredentials()  // Signal<boolean>
this.credentialsService.loading()  // Signal<boolean>
this.credentialsService.error()  // Signal<string | null>

// CRUD Operations (return Observables)
this.credentialsService.fetchCredentials()
this.credentialsService.createCredential(data)
this.credentialsService.updateCredential(id, data)
this.credentialsService.deleteCredential(id)
this.credentialsService.activateCredential(id)
this.credentialsService.testConnection(data)
```

### API Endpoints (Backend Must Implement)

```typescript
GET    /api/exchange-credentials              // List all credentials
GET    /api/exchange-credentials/:id          // Get by ID
POST   /api/exchange-credentials              // Create
PATCH  /api/exchange-credentials/:id          // Update
DELETE /api/exchange-credentials/:id          // Delete
POST   /api/exchange-credentials/:id/activate // Activate
POST   /api/exchange-credentials/test         // Test connection

// All Bybit endpoints should accept ?environment=TESTNET|MAINNET
GET    /api/bybit/user-info?environment=TESTNET
GET    /api/bybit/wallet-balance?environment=MAINNET
```

### Navigation Paths

```typescript
import { ROUTE_PATHS } from './app.routes';

// List credentials
this.router.navigate([ROUTE_PATHS.SETTINGS.EXCHANGE_CREDENTIALS.LIST]);

// Add credential
this.router.navigate([ROUTE_PATHS.SETTINGS.EXCHANGE_CREDENTIALS.ADD]);

// Edit credential
this.router.navigate([ROUTE_PATHS.SETTINGS.EXCHANGE_CREDENTIALS.EDIT('cred_123')]);

// Filter by exchange
this.router.navigate([ROUTE_PATHS.SETTINGS.EXCHANGE_CREDENTIALS.BY_EXCHANGE('bybit')]);
```

### Common Patterns

**React to Environment Changes in Component:**
```typescript
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private environmentService: ExchangeEnvironmentService) {
    effect(() => {
      const env = this.environmentService.currentEnvironment();
      console.log('Environment changed:', env);
      // React to change
    });
  }
}
```

**Display Credentials in Template:**
```typescript
@Component({
  template: `
    <div *ngIf="loading()">Loading...</div>
    <div *ngIf="error()">Error: {{ error() }}</div>
    <div *ngFor="let cred of credentials()">
      {{ cred.exchange }} - {{ cred.environment }}
    </div>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  protected readonly credentials: Signal<ExchangeCredential[]>;
  protected readonly loading: Signal<boolean>;
  protected readonly error: Signal<string | null>;

  constructor(private credentialsService: ExchangeCredentialsService) {
    this.credentials = this.credentialsService.credentials;
    this.loading = this.credentialsService.loading;
    this.error = this.credentialsService.error;
  }
}
```

**Create Credential:**
```typescript
const data: CreateExchangeCredentialRequest = {
  exchange: ExchangeType.BYBIT,
  environment: EnvironmentType.TESTNET,
  apiKey: 'your-key',
  apiSecret: 'your-secret',
  label: 'My Account'
};

this.credentialsService.createCredential(data).subscribe({
  next: (credential) => {
    console.log('Created:', credential);
    this.router.navigate(['/settings/exchange-credentials']);
  },
  error: (error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
});
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Signals Instead of BehaviorSubject?

1. **Performance**: Signals provide fine-grained reactivity
2. **Simplicity**: Cleaner API, no need to unsubscribe
3. **Modern**: Angular's recommended approach for state management
4. **Compatibility**: Can convert to Observable with `toObservable()`

### Why Service-Based State Instead of NgRx?

1. **Complexity**: NgRx adds significant boilerplate for this use case
2. **Scope**: State is service-specific, not application-wide
3. **Learning Curve**: Easier for team to understand and maintain
4. **Future**: Can migrate to NgRx later if needed

### Why Separate Environment and Credentials Services?

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service has one clear purpose
2. **Reusability**: Environment service can be used by multiple services
3. **Testability**: Easier to test services in isolation
4. **Flexibility**: Can swap implementations independently

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Never log full API keys or secrets
- [ ] Always mask API keys in UI (show only last 4 chars)
- [ ] Never store credentials in localStorage
- [ ] Always use HTTPS for API calls
- [ ] JWT token automatically attached via interceptor
- [ ] Backend encrypts credentials at rest
- [ ] Backend validates credentials before storing
- [ ] Backend never returns full API secrets

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Services not found

**Solution**: Ensure services are in `providedIn: 'root'`

### Issue: Signals not updating in template

**Solution**: Make sure you're calling the signal as a function: `credentials()` not `credentials`

### Issue: Environment changes not triggering refetch

**Solution**: Check that effect is properly set up in constructor:
```typescript
constructor(private environmentService: ExchangeEnvironmentService) {
  effect(() => {
    const env = this.environmentService.currentEnvironment();
    this.fetchData();
  });
}
```

### Issue: CORS errors when calling API

**Solution**: Backend must include CORS headers. Frontend proxy config may be needed for development.

### Issue: 401 errors

**Solution**: Check that auth interceptor is properly configured and JWT token is valid.

## Next Steps After Implementation

1. **User Documentation**: Create user guide for managing credentials
2. **Backend Implementation**: Ensure all API endpoints are implemented
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all flows
4. **Security Audit**: Review security implementation
5. **Performance Testing**: Test with realistic data volumes
6. **Deployment**: Deploy to staging environment
7. **User Acceptance Testing**: Get feedback from users
8. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to production
