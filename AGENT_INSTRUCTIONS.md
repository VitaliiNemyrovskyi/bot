# Agent Instructions

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-01

## Purpose

This file contains custom instructions, guidelines, and context that ALL specialized agents should follow when working on this project. These instructions augment the base agent capabilities and ensure consistency across all agent interactions.

## How This File Is Used

- All agents (chief-architect, angular-architect, ui-component-master, nextjs-api-architect, crypto-exchange-integrator, trading-backtest-engine, project-scribe, qa-testing-specialist) read these instructions before performing any task
- Instructions here override general best practices when there's a conflict
- Agents prioritize project-specific conventions defined here over common industry standards
- This file should be updated whenever new patterns or conventions are established

## When to Update This File

- When you establish a new coding pattern or convention
- After making architectural decisions that should be followed consistently
- When you discover anti-patterns or approaches to avoid
- When integrating new libraries or tools with specific usage guidelines
- After code reviews that reveal needed standards

[Add your instructions here]

Examples:

Test Coverage Requirements:
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage for all business logic
- Aim for 90%+ coverage on critical paths (authentication, payment flows)
- Services and utilities must have 100% coverage
- Components should have at least 70% coverage

Testing Frameworks and Tools:
- Unit Tests: Jest (Backend), Karma + Jasmine (Angular)
- E2E Tests: Cypress or Playwright
- Test Utilities: Testing Library, Angular Testing Library
- Coverage: Istanbul/nyc
- Mocking: Jest mocks, ng-mocks for Angular

Naming Conventions:
- Test files: [name].spec.ts (unit/integration), [name].e2e.ts (E2E)
- Test suites: describe('ComponentName', ...) or describe('ServiceName', ...)
- Test cases: it('should [expected behavior] when [condition]', ...)
- Use descriptive names that explain what is being tested

Test Organization:
- Co-locate unit tests with source files (e.g., user.service.ts + user.service.spec.ts)
- Place integration tests in tests/integration/
- Place E2E tests in e2e/ or cypress/ directory
- Group related tests using nested describe blocks
- Use beforeEach/afterEach for common setup/teardown

When to Write Each Test Type:
- Unit Tests: For isolated components, services, pipes, directives, utilities
- Integration Tests: For API endpoints, database operations, service interactions
- E2E Tests: For critical user workflows, authentication flows, purchase flows
- Visual Regression: For UI components with complex styling

CI/CD Testing Requirements:
- All tests must pass before merging to main branch
- Run unit tests on every commit
- Run integration tests on PR creation
- Run E2E tests nightly and before releases
- Generate and upload coverage reports
- Fail builds if coverage drops below threshold

Mock/Stub Patterns:
- Use Jest mocks for external dependencies
- Use ng-mocks for Angular dependencies
- Stub HTTP calls with HttpTestingController (Angular)
- Mock time-dependent functions (setTimeout, Date.now)
- Create test fixtures/factories for complex data structures
- Use spy functions to verify method calls

Test Data Management:
- Use factories or builders for test data creation
- Keep test data isolated and independent
- Reset database state between integration tests
- Use fixtures for consistent test scenarios
- Avoid hardcoded IDs, use factories to generate unique values
- Seed minimal data required for each test

Testing Best Practices:
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Keep tests focused on a single concern
- Make tests independent and isolated
- Use meaningful assertions with clear error messages
- Test error cases and edge conditions
- Avoid testing implementation details
- Mock external services (APIs, databases) in unit tests
- Use real services in integration tests where appropriate
```

## Technology-Specific Rules

### Angular-Specific Conventions

<!-- Add Angular-specific rules -->
**File Structure:**
```
[Add your conventions here]

Examples:
- Feature modules should be organized by business domain

- Use index.ts barrel exports for public APIs
```

**Component Guidelines:**
```
[Add your guidelines here]

Examples:
- Use OnPush change detection strategy by default
- Unsubscribe from observables in ngOnDestroy
- Keep component logic minimal, delegate to services
- Use smart/presentational component pattern
```

**State Management:**
```
[Add your state management approach here]

Examples:
- Use NgRx for global application state
- Use component state for local UI state
- Use services with BehaviorSubject for shared state between components
- Avoid nested subscriptions, use operators like switchMap instead
```

<!-- Add Next.js backend patterns -->
**API Routes:**
```
[Add your API patterns here]

Examples:
- Use /api/v1 prefix for all API routes
