I would like to create new feature. Here are some idea:
1. Implement functionality to trade on selected trading platform 
2. User should be able to open Limit and Market orders
3. User should be able to set Stop Loss and Take Profit levels
4. User should be able to view their open positions and order history
5. User should be able to view real-time price charts with technical indicators
6. User should be able to stop trading and close on or all open positions
7. Use websockets for real-time data updates
8. Implement error handling and logging for all trading operations
9. Invoke appropriate agents for each operation
10. Do changes attentively to avoid breaking existing functionality
11. Write unit tests for new functionality
12. Ensure code follows best practices and is well-documented
